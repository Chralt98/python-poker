# Python Poker Probabilities
### graphical user interface poker card simulation to calculate the probabilities for opponent cards
##### How to use the GUI correctly?
*Select cards on the GUI!*
1. **first two cards** are your cards.
2. **next three cards** are the flop, so the table open visible cards. 
3. **fourth card** is the turn, part of table open visible cards.
4. **fifth card** is the river, also part of table open visible cards.
5. **sixth card** restarts the round. Deck is shuffled.

**New:**
Burn cards with right click! Pre flop hand ranking. 
Ace low straight added. 
Main to opponent player comparison.
Added probability to get a specific hand ranking after flop.
Added chance to get a better rank.

**optional:** You can also restart the round with the button CLEAR.

* You can see the probabilities for hand rankings in the terminal.
