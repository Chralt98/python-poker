1. **first two cards** are your cards.
2. **next three cards** are the flop, so the table open visible cards. 
3. **fourth card** is the turn, part of table open visible cards.
4. **fifth card** is the river, also part of table open visible cards.
5. **sixth card** restarts the round. Deck is shuffled.
